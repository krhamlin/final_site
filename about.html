		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="dropcap">Hi!</span> My name is Kyle R. Hamlin and I am from Snohomish, WA where I was raised. I graduated from Snohomish High School and Everett Community College where I've taken a wide variety of courses ranging from sciences to web development to the basics of Math and English. 
		<hr>I currently live in Cheney, WA where I go to Eastern Washington University. I am planning to graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology. As I am attending EWU, I am a Community Advisor in the residence halls, currently as the Transfer Eastern Living Learning Community CA. <a href="http://access.ewu.edu/housing/reshalloverview/living-learning-communities">Learn more about LLC&#39;s here.</a> Along with working for Housing and Residential Life, I also volunteer my time with the campus programming board, Eagle Entertainment, where I have assisted with large-scale productions such as the Andy Grammer concert in Spring 2015, down to the small stuff such as the quarterly event titled "Up All Night" where students spend a break away from studying for finals to relax and enjoy some things they normally don't get to with a lot of free swag.
		<hr>My future career plans are to go into Student Affairs. After graduation I want to travel to more places around the world since I have been all over Europe a couple times and many places around the states.</p>
